# Snapshots

**Freshly baked Harmonoid builds directly from [HEAD of the repository](https://github.com/harmonoid/harmonoid).**

## Introduction

These Harmonoid builds are generated with a sole purpose of [receiving confirmation & user-feedback](https://github.com/harmonoid/harmonoid/issues) after a bug-fix/feature-implementation has been made _i.e._ in simple words, testing. For general & daily usage, the stable builds may be downloaded from [here](https://harmonoid.com/downloads/).

**WARNING:** These nightly builds also do not reflect the quality & stability of the actual stable versions of Harmonoid. These builds are not-indended for daily usage & **can also break your existing music library cache or other things**. Thus, please do not install unless recommended by developers themselves.

## Download
